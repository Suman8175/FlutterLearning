The "Column" widget in Flutter is a multi-purpose layout widget that is used to display its children in a vertical fashion, similar to the Row widget but with a default direction of Axis.vertical.

 

The Column widget takes several properties, including:

 

children: a list of widgets that are placed inside the Column.
mainAxisAlignment: the alignment of the children along the main axis. It can be one of MainAxisAlignment.start, MainAxisAlignment.end, MainAxisAlignment.center, MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween, MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround, or MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly.
crossAxisAlignment: the alignment of the children along the cross axis. It can be one of CrossAxisAlignment.start, CrossAxisAlignment.end, CrossAxisAlignment.center, CrossAxisAlignment.stretch, or CrossAxisAlignment.baseline.
mainAxisSize: the size of the main axis. It can be MainAxisSize.max or MainAxisSize.min.
